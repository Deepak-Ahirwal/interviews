* https://github.com/sunilsoni/Codility-Practice/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codility/lessons/BinaryGap/BinaryGap.java[*Binary Gap:*] Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

 You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
